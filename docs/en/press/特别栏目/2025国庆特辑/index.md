# 2025 National Day Special Edition
As time turns, we usher in the 2025 National Day. This year is a special one, and one worth remembering for all. Over the past 14 months, **MCJPG** has been writing its legend through innovation and unremitting effort. Let us look back at the extraordinary moments of this year and witness the brilliant achievements.

## Great Achievement: Mastering the Entire AI Industrial Chain

In 2025, the **MCJPG** organization elevated its business development to a new height, completing the creation of a full AI industrial chain. From technology R&D to user experience, and from API architecture to community services, we have achieved independent control from upstream to downstream, further solidifying our pioneering role in the industry. Notably, for the community's [AI Chat](https://chat.mcjpg.org), we adopted a groundbreaking ~~(truly groundbreaking)~~ technical architecture
significantly optimizing the availability and ease of use of [ChatAPI](https://chatapi.mcjpg.org). Updates to the user interface and performance improvements make every interaction smoother. We also launched the **[FreeChat](https://freechat.mcjpg.org)** service, providing a convenient AI dialogue solution for visitors and temporary users.

## Significant Improvements in Network Performance

We are well aware that the digital experience of the new era demands higher service speed. This year, the organization conducted deep optimization of the network access lines for various sites, driving experience upgrades through technical innovation—resulting in faster response times and superior loading speeds. Based on a strong digital foundation, **MCJPG** has built a technological high ground for the new era through solid technical expertise and financial investment.

## Incubating a High-Quality Community—MCFlare

This year, **MCJPG** successfully incubated the technical exchange community [MCFlare](https://forum.mcflare.com), creating a new home for resource sharing and technical gameplay exchange. Within the **MCFlare** community, players and server owners can not only exchange knowledge on server architecture and gameplay innovation but also freely enjoy the AI dialogue feature, which has become a unique hallmark of integrated community collaboration.
This is the successor to our previous, short-lived [Community Forum](https://com.mcjpg.org). We learned from prior experience, changed the management structure, and established a more effective and reasonable management mechanism by incubating **MCFlare** as a sub-project of **MCJPG**.

## Powerful Alliance: Breaking Down Barriers in the Server Ecosystem through Cooperation

Another major highlight of the year comes from cooperation. We have reached in-depth partnerships with two well-known Minecraft forums— **HiMCBBS** and **Zitbbs**. By integrating resources and closely coordinating, we have further connected the server ecosystem. Players can experience more diverse content and exchange more varied gameplay across platforms, while server owners can acquire a broader user base. This truly connects the entire community, illustrating the art of open collaboration.

Through technological innovation, we stride towards a boundless future; in community service, we guide a sense of warm belonging. Thanks to mutual trust and support, **MCJPG** has grown steadily throughout this year and welcomed many more moments of notable luminescence. In the future, we will continue to navigate by the principles of open-source and shared use, marching together to build **MCJPG** into the beacon platform of **Minecraft** in the digital age.

## Finally

**On this National Day holiday, we sincerely wish every player, developer, and ambitious innovator a happy holiday! The MCJPG Organization will, as always, work with you to create new brilliance!**
